    Chrome, Opera -> Blink  V8
    Firefox -> Gecko        GreaseMonkey
    Edge -> Trident         Chakra

Browser has two parts:
    1. Layout Engine (HTML + CSS)
    2. JS Engine or Interpreter (DOM (document), BOM (window), Console)

Ecosystem like this is created -> WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere)

Centralized Package Manager is introduced by developers in such an ecosystem.

python->pip
ruby->gem
      bundle
nodejs->npm,yarn

By using these two programs(npm, yarn) we can install nodejs programs into our computer and  also install nodejs libraries into out programs.
